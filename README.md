# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
A webpage that will help me to study throughout the duration of the coding bootcamp by having a place for all my notes on each of the coding languages we have gone over. I was motiveated to build this in order to make my life easier whenever we take a deeper dive into the bootcamp having a place to store notes and other useful information on the topics we are learning about will prove advantageous in the coming months as we will be improving apon the skills we already learned in Prework such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
